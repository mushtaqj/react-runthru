      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "You guys may have noticed my statuses' and post on social media promoting the protests and bashing our president. I rarely share my political views or gripes on social media for 2 reasons\n\nIt's not going to solve the issues or make a change.\nPeople are quick to judge your motivations, because I'm part of a minority whom the media and politicians have been kind enough to demonize to play their divide and conquer game.\nBUT ....\n\nWith everything that has happened in the past 2 years from\n\nExploding gas cylinders\nThe imports of substandard coconut oil\nThe sugar scam using covid to relax tax import laws\nTo the current situation where there are no essential medicines, people dying in queues, old people staying in queues for days to get the basic necessities\nI have not been personally affected by any of these, nor did my immediate family because the middle class and above have been able to put up with these\n\nBUT ....\n\nShould I wait till it personally affects me to speak up ? I joined the protests for three reasons\n\nAccountability should be part of the system, we are chanting #GoHomeGota but what people are really doing is sending a message to all future leaders, yes it is laughable, but doesn’t hurt to try, I would rather try and fail and then be laughed at, than not tray, still fail and still laughed at.\nBecause I’m privileged enough to provide my family 3 meals a day without standing in queues for days for essentials and have spare time to be “frustrated at the government for the inflation and power cuts” whereas for most of our country men the battle is putting the next meal on the table. I wish to use this “privilege” to represent those people, to stand not just me most of the protestors do this because of this very reason.\nMy fellow Millennials and the Gen Z inspire me, ignite hope in me. As long as I remember I never felt so much hope for our country as we have been steadily electing thieves to the highest position and we always said “Yeah, but even if he steals he will do something”, we compromised our standards, not anymore.\nI know I’m stupid to even hope, but this time if we fail we will know that we did not compromise and we did not take it lying down",

List of medicine suppliers from South Asian countries will be provided\n2. Since we are short on our reserves, they are expecting expats to pay for the shipments in dollars\n3. The clerance will be handled by the supplier and the MOH in Sri Lanka\n\nThis is only to get life saving essentials. Sorry if I confused you guys, we have money to donate but our currency is useless right now :-)",
